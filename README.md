presents a secure client server communication system implemented in Python using RSA encryption and SHA256 hashing. The demonstration covers key generation, socket-based connections, public-key exchange, encrypted message transmission, and cryptographic integrity verification. The project highlights core concepts in applied cryptography, including asymmetric encryption, hashing functions, secure protocols, and secure message validation.
